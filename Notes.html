			<h3>Flex-Shrink/Flex-Grow</h3>
			<p>The flex-shrink property takes numbers as values. The higher the number, the more it will shrink compared to the other items in the container. For example, if one item has a flex-shrink value of 1 and the other has a flex-shrink value of 3, the one with the value of 3 will shrink three times as much as the other.</p>
			<p>Using a similar example from the last challenge, if one item has a flex-grow value of 1 and the other has a flex-grow value of 3, the one with the value of 3 will grow three times as much as the other.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Flex-Wrap</h3>
			<p>nowrap: this is the default setting, and does not wrap items.</p>
			<p>wrap: wraps items from left-to-right if they are in a row, or top-to-bottom if they are in a column.</p>
			<p>wrap-reverse: wraps items from right-to-left if they are in a row, or bottom-to-top if they are in a column.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Justify-Content</h3>
			<p>flex-start: aligns items to the start of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the left of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the top of the container. This is the default alignment if no justify-content is specified.</p>
			<p>space-between: aligns items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed between the items. The first and last items are pushed to the very edge of the flex container. For example, in a row the first item is against the left side of the container, the last item is against the right side of the container, then the remaining space is distributed evenly among the other items.</p>
			<p>space-around: similar to space-between but the first and last items are not locked to the edges of the container, the space is distributed around all the items with a half space on either end of the flex container.</p>
			<p>space-evenly: Distributes space evenly between the flex items with a full space at either end of the flex container</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Align-Items</h3>
			<p>flex-start: aligns items to the start of the flex container. For rows, this aligns items to the top of the container. For columns, this aligns items to the left of the container.</p>
			<p>flex-end: aligns items to the end of the flex container. For rows, this aligns items to the bottom of the container. For columns, this aligns items to the right of the container.</p>
			<p>center: align items to the center. For rows, this vertically aligns items (equal space above and below the items). For columns, this horizontally aligns them (equal space to the left and right of the items).</p>
			<p>stretch: stretch the items to fill the flex container. For example, rows items are stretched to fill the flex container top-to-bottom. This is the default value if no align-items value is specified.</p>
			<p>baseline: align items to their baselines. Baseline is a text concept, think of it as the line that the letters sit on.</p>
