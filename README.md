 My website practice

A good README file always includes:
-Titles and internal titles
    -Title should clearly explain what is here, and is usually a projects name
    -a H1 heading prefaced with #
    -H2 with ## and so on
-Introduction (the project's aim)
    -A summary of what the projects aim is and what problems it solves
    -Two to three sentences are enough for small projects
    -Or, if it's training, mention the incentive (hackathon, learn a technology, non-profit org, memorize material from workshops or courses)
-Technologies
    -What languages are used, the libraries, and versions
    -Helps with finding changes if certain updates cause code to break (where was the code working last?)
    -Helps with recruitment. IT recruiters browse candidates' GitHub accounts and look for keywords
-Launch
    -How to run the project
    -Minimum hardware requirements and such
